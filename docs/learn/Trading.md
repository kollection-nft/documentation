## Marketplace Contract

Kollection is based on a [decentralized marketplace protocol](https://github.com/kollection-nft/marketplace) that runs on Koinos blockchain.

The primary trading functions on Kollection that derive from this contract are the following:

Sell: This function allows NFT owners to list their digital assets for sale on the Kollection marketplace. Sellers will set the price and expiration dates of the item. Once listed, the NFT will be available for purchase by other users on the marketplace.

Cancel: This function allows NFT owners to cancel their active listed NFT.

Buy: Users can purchase listed NFTs on Kollection by using the buy function. Buyers will pay the listed price and occuring fees, for example marketplace fees or royalties. The NFT will be transferred to the user's wallet if the transaction was successful.

## Mana

Kollection will provide Mana for listing and purchasing of items on Kollection.
Mana for canceling a listing has to be paid by the user.

## Wallets

The Kollection marketplace website can be used with the following wallets:
- [Kondor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kondor/ghipkefkpgkladckmlmdnadmcchefhjl)
- [My Koinos Wallet](https://mykw.vercel.app/)

## Fees and Royalties
Kollection will charge a _2.5%_ marketplace fee on NFT sales.

The marketplace applies royalties since they are also part of the NFT contract standard KCS-2. 

Collections can ask for royalties of up to 10%. 

## Scam
As a NFT marketplace, we automatically display NFT collections based on the information stored on the blockchain. Unfortunately, this means that scam NFT collections could also be displayed on our platform if a malicious actor decides to upload them to the blockchain. While we do everything we can to prevent this, it's important to note that as a platform that works with decentralized protocols, we can't control the content displayed on the blockchain.

Therefore, we strongly advise our users to conduct proper research and due diligence before buying any NFTs to ensure their legitimacy. While we strive to provide a secure and transparent platform, ultimately, it is up to each individual to take responsibility for their transactions on our marketplace.

Additionally, we recommend that our users review the transaction events in Kondor or MKW to gain a better understanding of what happens when using Kollection. This will to identify any potential issues or irregularities.

If you see a collection which appears to be _scam_ or might have _violated copyright_, please [contact us](mailto:contact@kollection.app) immediately.
