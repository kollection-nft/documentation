## Overview

The Drops feature on Kollection is the first release of the Creator Tools suite.
Drops are a great way to launch your collection on Koinos. This feature eliminates the need to have a separate minting page, and also acts as marketing tool for your project. Mint on Kollection and get the maximum exposure in the NFT space of the Koinos blockchain.
